    Pasta aglio e olio. Dirt cheap but very tasty.
</h2>
<ul>
    Ingredients:
    <li>1 lb dried linguine</li>
    <li>12 cloves garlic
        <ul>
            <li>4 minced</li>
            <li>4 thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 smashed</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <br>
    Tools:
    <li>1 really big pot</li>
    <li>10 inch stainless steel pan</li>
    <li>Western chef's knife</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    Steps:
    <li>Put about 1.5 quarts of water in the pot. Salt it until it tastes like ocean water, 
        <br>then heat it until boiling. Once at a boil, add the linguine and cook just shy of doneness
    <br>about one minute before the package says so. You can take a bite and test for texture.<br>
        Strain in the sink, reserving about a cup of pasta water.</li>
    <li>Pour olive oil in pan and place the 4 smashed cloves in, then heat on high. Once it <br>
    starts to sizzle, turn the heat to low. Cook for about 5 to 7 minutes until garlic has browned. <br>
    Discard cloves once its done.</li>
    <li>Turn heat to high on the pan. Add sliced garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until garlic 
        <br>is pale brown, around 45 seconds. Then add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, around 30 seconds.
        <br>Remove from the heat and add butter, stirring until melted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Return linguine to the pot and heat over medium low. Pour the garlicky oil over the noodles and stir
        <br> to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
</ol>
